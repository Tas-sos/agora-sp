# Agora

The service portfolio management tool is a tool that allows a company / project to manage the portfolio of services they to maintain (offered to users / customers or internal).
Agora provides an intuitive user interface which allows users to create/edit/update/delete their services and components. Users can login with credentials provided by the administrator, or use the shibboleth login functionality to login with their academic account.


### Dependencies

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [virualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)


## Development instructions

### Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/grnet/agora-sp.git
```

### Create a virtualenv for agora

```
cd agora
mkvirtualenv agora
```

### Install requirements

With virtualenv activated install python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run `yarn` inside the `ui` directory to install npm depending libraries.

## Configuration

### Backend configuration

You can create a configuration file in order to override the default settings for the agora project. The default location of the .conf file is `/etc/agora/settings.conf`

The default contents of `settings.conf` are:

```
SQLITE = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': '/tmp/db.agora.sqlite3'
    }
}

DATABASES = SQLITE
EMAIL_FILE_PATH = '/tmp/agora/agora_emails'
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend'
```

You should override it with your database settings, [you can read more information here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/databases/).


**NOTE:** You must create a `log` folder containing a `debug.log` file in your base project directory or configure LOGGING setting with custom log options.


Finally, you should also create a `deployment.conf` file which should specify the `root_url` attribute to reflect the url of the backend server.

The default location of `deployment.conf` is in '/etc/agora/`.

Example: 

```
{
    ":root_url": "localhost"
}
```


### UI configuration

You can edit the `ui/config/environment.js` file to set the default configuration options. You can alter the value of `rootURL` and `appURL` that define where the ui is served and what is the main endpoint  where the backend is located.

Example options:

```
var ENV = {
  rootURL: '/ui/'
  appURL: 'api/v2/',
}
```

### UI Customization

You can customize the appearance of your installation by adding your own logo, style and domestic login method text.

You can place your own logo inside `public/assets` directory under the name `logo.png`.
You can also use a custom preprocessed stylesheet, which you should place inside `styles` folder.
In order to process it and import it, you have to edit `ui/config/environment.js` file and set the `theme` option to match the name of the stylesheet `my-themes.scss`:

```
var ENV = {
    theme: 'my-theme',
}
```

In case you want to alter the text for domestic login method, you can change the configuration option in `config/environment.js` as follows:

```
var ENV = {
  APP: {
    domestic_login_msg: "My login method"
  }
}

```

### Migrations

Run all migrations in order to construct the database schema.

You should run:

```
python manage.py migrate
```


### Development

Serve ui files by running the command from inside `ui/` directory:

```
./node_modules/.bin/ember build
```

This will create a `dist` , that will be served by Agora to deliver the UI.

Finally, run `python manage.py runserver` to test that the application is installed properly.

You can now view your application in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`


## Development with Docker

You will need [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

While on the root directory of the repo use the following command:
```
# docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will create a container for the backend (manage.py runserver) and the frontend (ember build --watch). The containers are named `agora-backend` and `agora-frontend` respectively.

Agora can be accessed at localhost:8000.

To check the output of the container use docker logs, e.g. `docker logs [-f] agora-backend`

The database will be created in the root directory, alongside docker-compose.yml (mydb-docker.sqlite3) and will be reused across docker builds. If you want to reset it, just remove the file. If you want to use an existing database, overwrite it. You'll probably need root, as Docker runs and therefore creates/modifies files as root.

If you want to run a shell in a container use
```
# docker exec -it agora-backend bash
```

If you want to attach to the running process use:
```
# docker attach agora-backend
```

## Running without docker-compose:
- To use the containers without docker-compose, you will have to build the containers, create and start them. You can check docker-compose.yml for info on options to use during container creation.
